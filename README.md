# Py Dictionary #

A simple dictionary written in Python

### Technologies Used ###
- Flask
- Sqlite3

### Aim of The Project ###
The main aim of this project is to create a simple web application which is capable of retrieving common information common to a particular word/phrase

### TODOs ###
All TODOs can be found in the "TODO" folder. The format of a TODO is `yyyy-mm-dd.md` (The date the TODO was created).

When TODOs are completed they should be crossed out. If all the TODOs in a "TODO" file have been completed then the TODO file can be deleted


### Future Target of The Project ###
I wish for the project to get a "release" version available to the public and also for the project to get a desktop app as well as a mobile app.

I plan the mobile app and the desktop app would only make use of the local database available otherwise they'll try to connect to a pre-configured server and (using the API endpoints on that server) retrieve information affiliated to the queried word/phrase
